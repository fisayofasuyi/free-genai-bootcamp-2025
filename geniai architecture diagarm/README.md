## System Architecture Diagram
(Refer to the attached compact architecture diagram)

## Requirements
Functional Requirements:
Learning Portal: Web-based and mobile-friendly portal for students to access lessons, exercises, and AI-powered features.
AI Services:
Speech Recognition for pronunciation evaluation.
Grammar Correction for sentence improvement.
Chatbot for conversational practice.
Personalized Learning for adaptive lesson recommendations.
Translator Service: Provides real-time translation support between multiple languages.
Content Moderation: Filters inappropriate content in user-generated interactions.

Backend Server: Handles API requests, authentication, and integrates AI models.
Database: Stores user progress, course content, and AI model outputs.

Non-Functional Requirements:
Scalability: Support for a growing number of users and AI model expansions.
Security: User authentication, data encryption, and compliance with data privacy laws.
Performance: Low-latency responses for real-time interactions.
Cross-Platform Compatibility: Accessible via web and mobile devices.

## Risks
Data Privacy Risks: Sensitive user data exposure if security measures are insufficient.
Model Accuracy Risks: AI models may produce incorrect grammar corrections or misinterpret speech input.
Integration Challenges: AI services and learning portal may have compatibility issues.
Scalability Risks: High traffic could impact system performance if not optimized properly.
User Adoption Risks: Students may struggle with AI-based interactions compared to human instructors.
Content Moderation Risks: AI-based moderation may incorrectly flag or allow inappropriate content.

## Assumptions
Users have stable internet access for real-time AI interactions.
AI models can be fine-tuned periodically to improve accuracy.
The existing Learning Portal supports API-based integrations.
The platform will support multiple languages in the future.
Users are comfortable interacting with AI-driven learning tools.
Translator service will have reliable language models for accurate translations.

## Constraints
Budget Constraints: Limited resources for AI model training and cloud infrastructure.
Technology Stack Limitations: Must align with the existing Learning Portal and database.
Compliance Requirements: Must adhere to GDPR, CCPA, and other data protection regulations.
AI Model Training Time: Continuous learning improvements may require periodic updates.
Hardware Limitations: Real-time speech recognition and NLP processing may require GPU-intensive servers.
Content Moderation Limitations: May require human oversight for edge cases.
